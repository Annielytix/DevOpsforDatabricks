## Azure Databricks  - Python & Dev Ops
#### Editted by Laura Edell on April 4, 2019

## Hands on Lab – Abstract
This hands on lab is designed for the scenario where a team of scientists and engineers are responsible for the development, maintenance and quality of analytical models which are made available to other teams for consumption.
## Infrastructure Set Up
This section covers all infrastructure between Azure Dev Ops and Azure resources for the HOL which must be completed prior to the lab.
## Azure Resource Creation
These steps should be completed ahead of time - It will make it easier to keep or save after the workshop - 

Step 1: Create Resource Groups - Begin by creating 3 resource groups:
•	[some-name]-db-dev
•	[some-name]-db-stage
•	[some-name]-db-prod



### Adding Resources to Resource Groups
Keep the following in mind:

Resource groups:

[some-name]-db-dev 
[some-name]-db-stage
[some-name]-db-prod 

will have different resources completely.
#### Add Machine Learning Service Workspace
1.	Select “Add a Resource”.

![alt text](./readme_images/add_resource.png)

2.	Search for “machine learning” and select “Machine Learning service workspace” published by Microsoft.  Click Create

7.	Fill out the creation form.  MAKE SURE you select “terminate after 120 minutes of inactivity” to help reduce accidental usage and billing.

![alt text](./readme_images/adb_cluster_creation_form.png)

#### Add AzureML SDK as Library to Cluster.
1.	From the DataBricks Workspace, click on “Clusters” and then the cluster name.

![alt text](./readme_images/select_cluster_for_configure.png)

2.	Click on the Libraries Tab, Install New, PyPl and enter “azureml-sdk”.  Click Install

![alt text](./readme_images/add_azml_sdk_to_cluster.png)

#### Add Initial Data to Storage
We want to ensure there is some data in the various data lakes so folks can access it.
1.	Download the file: https://amldockerdatasets.azureedge.net/AdultCensusIncome.csv 
2.	Select the storage v2 from your resource group.

![alt text](./readme_images/select_storage_gen2.png)

7.  Once Azure Storage Explorer is installed, open it.  Add an Account and Login using your Azure credentials.

![alt text](./readme_images/storage_explorer_add_account.png)

8.  Find your filesystem inside the account you have now added.  Drag and drop the AdultCensusIncome.csv into the main pane.  Click Refresh if it does not refresh automatically.

![alt text](./readme_images/storage_explorer_add_data.png)

#### Create Secrets for Secure & Controlled Storage Mounts
We parameterize out a few extra values such that the code for mounting data can remain the same regardless of which databricks cluster it is attached to and the access to data is controlled by a cluster & data lake admin instead.  These steps should be completed for each databricks workspace within each resource group.
##### Install Azure & Data Bricks CLI
1.	Ensure python 3.x is installed.
a.	If it is not; the easiest way is to install Anaconda.
b.	https://www.anaconda.com/download/ 
2.	Install the data bricks cli
a.	Open a cmd prompt and execute the command: “pip install databricks-cli”
3.	Install the azure cli
a.	Open a cmd prompt and execute the command: “pip install azure-cli”
##### Configure Data Bricks CLI for User
###### Generate a User Access Token
1.	Launch the DataBricks Workspace from the Azure Portal

![alt text](./readme_images/launch_adb_workspace.png)

2.	In the upper right hand side of the screen, select the user icon.

![alt text](./readme_images/select_adb_user_icon.png)

3.	Select “User Settings” from the drop down.
4.	Select “Generate a New Token”

![alt text](./readme_images/generate_adb_token.png)

5.	Give a good comment and remove the token lifetime (gives permanent token access to cluster; not a best practice)

![alt text](./readme_images/adb_token_life.png)

6.	Copy the token that gets generated.
###### Authenticate CLI with Token using Profiles
1.	Use the command “databricks configure --token --profile [PROFILENAME]
a.	HINT: use dev, test & prod similar to how you named the workspaces and resources groups to more easily differentiate.
2.	Enter the host URL
a.	https://eastus.azuredatabricks.net (example)
b.	Paste the token generated from the previous step
3.	To use the profiles capability; simply use the –profile flag with the [PROFILENAME] configured to configure the workspace you are targeting.
###### Create Service Principal and Give Access to Data Lake
This section uses an AD Service principal and provides access to the principal for the data.
1.	Login in to the azure cli by executing the command: “az login”
a.	Follow instructions printed out.
2.	Create a service principal by executing the command: “az ad sp create-for-rbac –name [SOMENAME]”
a.	Copy the app id
b.	COPY the password – you will not be able to get it again.
3.	Get the Service Principal’s object id by executing the command: “az ad sp show –id [AppId]”.  Search through the result and find the value of the property “objectId”
b.	Copy the objectID

![alt text](./readme_images/copy_sp_obj_id.png)

4.	Open Azure Storage Explorer and right click the datalake container you created previously.  Select “Manage Access”

5.	Paste the objectID into the text box and click “Add”

![alt text](./readme_images/paste_obj_id_as_user_to_dl.png)

6.	Find the object ID in the list, click on it and give it Read, Write & Execute Access as well as Default.  Click Save

![alt text](./readme_images/grant_sp_dl_access.png)

7.	Navigate to the Azure Portal and to the ADLS Gen Two Blade for this resource group.  Click on Access Control (IAM)

![alt text](./readme_images/acccess_control_pane_adls_gen2.png)

8.	Click on “Add” “Add role assignment”

![alt text](./readme_images/add_role_adls_gen2.png)

9.	The role should be: “Storage Blob Data Contributor” and enter the name for the service principal for this resource group you created and click save.

![alt text](./readme_images/adls_gen2_role_add_form.png)

###### Create an Azure Key Vault Backed Secret Scope
1.	Navigate to your workspace with the following format:
a.	https://eastus.azuredatabricks.net/?o=6776691945951303#secrets/createScope 
b.	Replace the number after o= with yours:

![alt text](./readme_images/get_adb_workspace_id.png)

c.	Or simply append #secrets/createScope to the end of the url of your workspace.
2.	Navigate to the key vault for the resource group you are setting up:

![alt text](./readme_images/navigate_key_vault.png)

3.	Copy the DNS name

![alt text](./readme_images/copy_kv_dns_name.png)

4.	Copy the Resource ID

![alt text](./readme_images/copy_kv_resource_id.png)

5.	Name the scope “data-lake”, set for “All Users”.  Populate the dns name and resource id of the key vault. And select “Create".

![alt text](./readme_images/adb_create_secret_scope.png)

6.	From the databricks CLI, enter the command: “databricks secrets list-scopes –profile [YOUR PROFILE]

![alt text](./readme_images/confirm_kv_backed_secret_scope.png)

###### Add Secrets to Secret Scope for Accessing Data
You will need the Service Principal’s password and app id from the previous steps.
1.	Get the app’s tenant id by executing the following command: “az ad sp show –id [AppId]”
a.	Copy the value from: “appOwnerTenantId”.
2.	Add the Service Principal’s TenantID to the Azure Key Vault
a.	“az keyvault secret set –vault-name [KeyVault for RG] –name “sp-tenant-id” –value [TenantId]”
3.	Add the Service Principal App-ID to the Azure Key Vault

    1.  "az keyvault secret set --vault-name [KeyVault for RG] --name ml-workspace-name --value YOURVALUE

![alt text](./readme_images/mlservice_name.png)

10.  Add the "Alg State"  This changes per resource group.  For the Dev RG, it is "dev", for "stage" it is "stage".  If you were to add additional clusters for releases for multi-tenancy it should have a convention to help support that.
     1.   "az keyvault secret set --vault-name [KeyVault for RG] --name alg-state --value APPROPRIATEVALUE

11.  Add the "Created By".  For now this will simply match "Alg State"'s conventions.

![alt text](./readme_images/adb_git_link_settings_form.png)

# Dev Loop Experience
The dev loop experience encompasses mounting the dev data, exploring that data, training a model; writing the inference code, compiling a dev container; running tests inside the dev container.
## Train the world’s worst regression & Stage for inference coding.
1.	Copy the code from Project_One/notebooks/train_model.py into your databricks train_model.py which was created earlier.
1.  The proctor will step through what exactly the code is doing and why.
    1.  Essentially: The precreated secrets are being used to mount to various stores securely and will allow zero code changes as the algorithm progresses across secure environments.  
    2.  You train a super simple algorithm and register the resulting model files with the AZML service such that we can bridge the divide between databricks and inference coding.  This process is ML Framework independent and can be used cross algorithms, frameworks etc.
## Inference Coding
This section extends from having a trained model to now building an inference container which is reflective of the asset we will deliver to our customer base.

Code Structure

![alt text](./readme_images/inference_code_structure.png)

Good Code Structure from the beginning is a great way to ensure you are set up well.  In this case we are going to follow well defined development strategies via a bit of a hybrid between .net project structures and python project structures.
 
We have two folders for each project.  Project_One is the primary inference project
### Git Pull the train code
1.	Open a cmd prompt.
2.	Change directory into the root of where your project is.
3.	Execute the command:
a.	“git checkout <YOURBRANCHNAME>”
b.	“git pull”
### Test Driven Development

#### Write a Test
You should always start with testing and then writing code to satisfy those tests.  The only code which will be required to write is the test_model.py.  The facilitation code here is provided for you.

![alt text](./readme_images/test_model_view.png)
 
Inside this file we will write a very simple unit test to ensure that the x_scaler object is populated during model initialization.

1.  An example unit test has already been written.  Add 1 more unit test to Project_One-Tests/test_model.py.
2.  The facilitation code follows standard pytest rules, so you can even add more test files etc; just follow pytest conventions.
3.  The proctor will run through how the project works.
    1.  Project_One is the project code which seperates the inference code as a "provider" type class following similiar principals from the testable web dev space.  
    2.  Project_One-Tests is your seperated testing code such that it is not coupled with your app development code.
    3.  A container is built for the inference code, which is then extended with the test code.  The base inference container is the asset expected to be deployed while the extended testing container allows you to test the assets in the same type of format as if they were to be compiled.

#### Review Inference Code
Normally we would test and ensure the tests fail before writing the inference code; however much of the code is already written, so we will simply review it.

![alt text](./readme_images/inference_code_review.png)

In an ideal world, the only code you would need to worry about is highlighted in red.  The current state of tooling as of today is why the other code exists and is not wrapped up as ADO Tasks or VS Code extensions.  

The proctor will run through the code with your, but essentially:
1.  ./Project_One/score.py is what the azure ml sdk expects as the interface and must be populated with an init() and a run(params).  The params are what is received in the http request body (or iot edge message over the route)
2.  The code placed in inference_code is to help ensure code coverage is reported appropriately.  We follow a similar provider type structure as in web dev when there is a pre-defined functional interface.  The objective is to minimize that footprint to 1 line of code. (in score.py init and run)
3.  The rest of the code is a dockerized build process that can run independent of the dependencies installed on your system such that the build on your machine is the same as the build in the build server improving confidence the locally generated and tested asset will match the asset which has probability of being promoted to production.

We now have inference code with matching train code.  Lets build the inference container and test it.
### Build Inference Container
1.	First open runbuild_local.cmd
a.	Modify the environment variables to match for the dev environment.  These will remain constant for this algorithm and your local environment.
i.	Subscription_id
ii.	Ml_resource_group
iii.	Ml_workspace_name
iv.	Ml_alg_author
From the command prompt:
1.	Change directory into the Project_One folder.
2.	Run the runbuild_local.cmd
a.	You may need to execute az login prior to executing this command or be interactively logged in (watch the output)

![alt text](./readme_images/run_build_local.png)

c.	This will execute a bunch of stuff and be on “Creating image” for a while.  Occasionally hit enter to see if the cmd prompt output is up to date or not.

![alt text](./readme_images/successful_local_build.png)

### Test Inference Container
1.	Change directory into the Project_One-Tests folder.
2.	Run the runtests_local.cmd file
3.	This will extend the container you created in the previous step, run your unit tests and check your code coverage.  The code coverage results can be found in C:/ml_temp/artifacts/test_results  These are standard pytest and pytest-cov result outputs.

![alt text](./readme_images/test_results.png)

5.	Click on index.html from cov_html folder

![alt text](./readme_images/local_test_results_web.png)

7.	We have 68% code coverage; could be worse.
## Commit & Pull Request.
1.	We now know that we have an inference container and it passes our unit tests and our code coverage is to a point where we are happy about it.
2.	From the command prompt change directory to the root of the repository.
3.	Execute the following commands to push the changes from your branch:
a.	Git add ./
b.	Git commit -m “works”
c.	Git push
4.	Create a pull request by going to your ADO site, under repos, pull request, New Pull Request

![alt text](./readme_images/create_pull_request.png)

5.	Populate the request template and ensure you have a reviewer:

![alt text](./readme_images/PR_options_form.png)

6.	Review the changes with the reviewer you selected.  Ensure both enter ADO and hit “Approve” and then “Complete”.  If you see problems in your peers code; add comments and reject it.  Once both reviewers Approve you can complete.  This will launch the build stages & release stages which are connected to master.
 
# Defining your Build stage

Since we are targeting a different Azure Databricks Environment than the one used in the local Dev Loop described earlier in this document, and since we are concerned with security we will be creating a library asset which will allow us to define secrets from a key vault that points to this new environment. These secrets become available as variables in the build stage. Variables give you a convenient way to get key bits of data into various parts of the stage. As the name suggests, the value of a variable may change from run to run or job to job of your stage. Almost any place where a stage requires a text string or a number, you can use a variable instead of hard-coding a value. The system will replace the variable with its current value during the stage's execution.

## Creating a Variable Group

1.	In your Azure DevOps Subscription navigate to the Library Menu Item and click + Variable Group

![alt text](./readme_images/create_variable_group_ado.png)

2.	Name your variable group as indicated and select the Azure Subscription and KeyVault that you wish to target and toggle the “Link secrets from an Azure key vault as variables” switch to the on position
 
 ![alt text](./readme_images/ado_variable_group_form.png)

3.	Click the + Add button, select the variables that you want to make available to the stage, click ok and then Save to make sure that your changes are persisted to your Azure DevOps instance
 
![alt text](./readme_images/ado_variable_group_available_to_stage.png)

## Create a Build stage in the Visual Designer

The intention of this step is to create an Azure DevOps stage that will mimic the steps from the Local Build Loop, but targets a different Azure Databrick Environment for the training .The connection details of this environment will not be available to the scientists directly and will be managed by the operations team. This stage will execute when a PR to master is approved and completed.
1.	In your Azure DevOps tenant, navigate to stages -> Builds and click on + New and select New build stage.
 
![alt text](./readme_images/ado_new_build_stage.png)

2.	Select your source and make sure to select the master branch as we want to make sure that the stage is attached the branch that we will be monitoring for Pull Requests. Click Continue.

![alt text](./readme_images/ado_build_pipe_repo_type.png)

3.	Select Empty Job 

![alt text](./readme_images/ado_build_pipe_select_empty_job.png)

4.	Name your stage accordingly and select the Hosted Ubuntu 1604 Build Agent from the Agent Pool.

![alt text](./readme_images/ado_build_pipe_set_build_agent_type.png)

5.	Link the variable group that you created earlier by clicking on Variables in the menu bar, followed by Variable groups and click Link Variable Groups.

You can now Save and Queue this stage for a manual build to make sure that it executes from end to end without any issues. 

Output from the stage should resemble the following:

## Defining your Release stage

While release stages are often used to deliver artifacts in a deployed state, our scenario calls for an different approach. Our build artifact is an image that contains our tested model and we will be creating a Two Stage Release that will first deliver the correct image to aQA environment where it can be picked up and be tested by a product team. Once all conditions for the product team is satisfied a release manager will manually approve the Production release step and the model will become available for consumption in the Production Environment.
Creating Variable Groups Required for the Release stage
1.	Click on the Library menu item in the Azure DevOps portal and click 

![alt text](./readme_images/ado_rp_add_variable_group.png)

2.	Complete the resulting form as depicted below, making sure that you provide values to the variables that correspond to the Targeted QA Environment

3.	After each Variable Value has been assigned click the   to encrypt its value in the stage.
4.	Repeat Steps 2 and 3 above to set up a variable group for the targeted Production Environment.
### Create the Release stage
1.	In the Azure DevOps portal Click on stages -> Releases in the left menu

2.	Click The New stage menu item and select New release stage 

![alt text](./readme_images/ado_rp_new_rp.png) 

3.	Add Two Stages, Named QA and Production Respectively ensuring that you select the “Empty Template”. Click on the Pre-deployment condition icon     and continue to configure as depicted below. This will prevent the Production deployment from happening automatically unless there is an Approval provided by One or all of the Approvers (dependent on configuration) and that the Production Stage Deployment will timeout after two days with out an approval.

4.	Add the build artifacts and link the release stage to its associated build stage.

Note: The value  in the Source alias text area will be required to correctly configure the AZ CLI tasks in Steps 6 and 7 below.
 

5.	In the Menu area select variables and link the QA and Production variable to the relevant slots.

![alt text](./readme_images/ado_rp_qa_cli_2.png) 

** Make sure that the working directory set above reflects the generated path correct path here
$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/<Insert Correct Path Here>/stageArtifacts

7.	Repeat Step 6 above for the Production Stage . 

Note that the script internals are identical for both stages but will target different destination repositories based on the Variables groups assigned to each of the stages.

8.	Run a release and inspect the results
9.	To automate the release process click the Continuous Integration Trigger of the Build Artifact and set as follows.
